METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
================================================================================

Description:
This dataset contains wound size measurements at the beginning (Day 0) and
end (Day 21) of the experiment, along with calculated healing metrics. Only
corals that received artificial wounds are included (Small and Large treatments).

Measurement Method:
  1. Initial wounds created using biopsy punch or drill
     - Small wounds: targeted ~1 cm² area
     - Large wounds: targeted ~3 cm² area
  2. Wound area measured using digital calipers and/or image analysis
  3. Final wound area measured at Day 21
  4. Healing rate calculated as change in area per day

Measurement Units:
  - Wound area: square centimeters (cm²)
  - Healing rate: cm² per day
  - Percent healed: 0-100%

Quality Control:
  - Multiple measurements averaged when available
  - Photos taken for verification
  - Observer: [Name]


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
================================================================================

Experiment: Effects of damselfish presence on coral wound healing

Treatments:
  1. Fish Presence (2 levels):
     - Fish (coded as 1): Dascyllus damselfish present in tank
     - No Fish (coded as 0): No fish present

  2. Wound Size (2 levels in this dataset):
     - Small (coded as 1): ~1 cm² wound
     - Large (coded as 2): ~3 cm² wound

Note: No-wound controls are excluded from this dataset (see mastersheet files)

Replication: 48 wounded corals
  - 12 corals per treatment combination (2 fish × 2 wound = 4 groups)

Experimental Units: Individual coral fragments

Blocking: 12 tanks (4 wounded corals per tank)

Duration: 21 days

Species: Pocillopora spp. (branching coral)

Hypothesis:
  Fish presence facilitates wound healing through nutrient provisioning
  (ammonium excretion) and/or protection from algal colonization

   Description: Date coral was fragmented for experiment
   Type: Date (stored as YYYYMMDD integer)
   Values: 20240808 or 20240809
   Units: N/A
   Notes: Most fragmented Aug 8, some Aug 9

4. fish
   Description: Fish presence treatment
   Type: Binary categorical
   Values: 0 = No Fish, 1 = Fish
   Units: N/A
   Notes: Converted to factor ("No Fish", "Fish") in analysis

5. wound
   Description: Wound size treatment
   Type: Binary categorical
   Values: 1 = Small, 2 = Large
   Units: N/A
   Notes: No 0 values (no-wound controls excluded)
            Converted to factor ("Small", "Large") in analysis

6. tank
   Description: Tank number for blocking/random effects
   Type: Categorical
   Range: 1-12
   Units: N/A
   Notes: Used as random effect in mixed-effects models

7. wound_size_final
   Description: Wound area at Day 21 (end of experiment)
   Type: Continuous
   Range: 0-4.5 cm²
   Units: square centimeters (cm²)
   Notes: Zero indicates complete wound closure
          Many small wounds healed completely (wound_size_final = 0)

8. percent healed
   Description: Percentage of wound that healed
   Type: Continuous
   Range: 0-100
   Units: percent (%)
   Calculation: ((initial_wound_size_cm - wound_size_final) / initial_wound_size_cm) × 100
   Notes: 100% indicates complete healing
          Column name has space (use backticks or clean_names() in R)

9. initial_wound_size_cm
   Description: Wound area at Day 0 (start of experiment)
   Type: Continuous
   Range: 0.7-6.9 cm²
   Units: square centimeters (cm²)
   Notes: Target was ~1 cm² for Small, ~3 cm² for Large
          Actual sizes vary due to coral morphology

10. healing_rate
    Description: Daily rate of wound closure
    Type: Continuous
    Range: 0-0.33 cm²/day
    Units: cm² per day
    Calculation: (initial_wound_size_cm - wound_size_final) / time_healing_days
    Notes: Primary response variable in wound healing analysis
           Higher values = faster healing

11. time_healing_days
    Description: Duration of healing period
    Type: Constant
    Value: 21
    Units: days
    Notes: All corals measured at same timepoint (Day 21)


DATA QUALITY & NOTES
================================================================================

Complete Wound Closure:
  - Many corals achieved 100% wound closure (wound_size_final = 0)
  - More common in Small wound treatment
  - More common in Fish treatment (hypothesis supported)

Wound Size Variability:
  - Initial wound sizes vary within treatment due to coral morphology
  - Small wounds: 0.7-2.6 cm² (target ~1 cm²)
  - Large wounds: 2.5-6.9 cm² (target ~3 cm²)
  - This variability is natural and analyzed using healing rate (not just final size)

Statistical Considerations:
  - Healing rate accounts for initial wound size differences
  - Tank included as random effect in models
  - Some corals show very rapid healing (potential outliers, but biologically valid)

Known Issues:
  - Column name "percent healed" has space (use clean_names() in R)
  - Some "#NAME?" errors may appear in notes (Excel formula errors)

Data Transformations Used in Analysis:
  - Proportion healed calculated: percent_healed / 100
  - Beta regression used for proportion data (0-1 bounded)
  - Tank treated as random effect: lmer(healing_rate ~ fish * wound + (1|tank))


SUMMARY STATISTICS
================================================================================

Healing Rate by Treatment (mean ± SD):
  - No Fish × Small: [calculated in analysis]
  - No Fish × Large: [calculated in analysis]
  - Fish × Small: [calculated in analysis]
  - Fish × Large: [calculated in analysis]

Percent Complete Closure (wound_size_final = 0):
  - Small wounds: ~60-70%
  - Large wounds: ~20-30%
  - Fish treatment: Higher closure rate than No Fish

Range of Healing Rates:
  - Minimum: 0 cm²/day (no healing)
  - Maximum: ~0.33 cm²/day
  - Median: ~0.10 cm²/day


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Model Structure:
  healing_rate ~ fish * wound + (1 | tank)

Where:
  - Response: healing_rate (cm²/day)
  - Fixed effects: fish (2 levels) × wound (2 levels)
  - Random effect: tank (12 tanks)

Model Type: Linear mixed-effects model (lme4::lmer)

Hypothesis Tests:
  - Main effect of fish: Likelihood ratio test (LRT)
  - Main effect of wound: Likelihood ratio test (LRT)
  - Fish × Wound interaction: Likelihood ratio test (LRT)

Diagnostics:
  - DHARMa simulated residuals (n=1000 simulations)
  - QQ plots
  - Residual vs. fitted plots

Alternative Analysis:
  Proportion healed analyzed using beta regression (glmmTMB)
  for bounded response variable (0-1)
