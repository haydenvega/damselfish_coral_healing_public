  - coral_delta.csv (processed growth deltas)

Analysis Scripts Using This File:
  - None directly (CSV version used in analyses)


METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
================================================================================

Description:
This Excel file contains the same buoyant weight measurements as the CSV file
(fish_regen_buoyantweight (1).csv) plus additional calculated columns for
seawater density, stopper density, dry mass, and coral volume.

Relationship to CSV File:
  - First 12 columns identical to fish_regen_buoyantweight (1).csv
  - Columns 13-18 contain derived metrics calculated from raw measurements

Purpose:
  - Intermediate calculations for skeletal mass and volume
  - Quality control and verification of derived metrics
  - Archive of calculation steps

Calculation Method:
  1. Calculate seawater density from temperature and salinity
  2. Calculate calibration stopper density from air/water weights
  3. Calculate coral dry mass from buoyant weight and densities
  4. Calculate coral volume from dry mass and aragonite density
  5. Calculate growth deltas between initial and final timepoints


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
================================================================================

Experiment: Effects of damselfish presence on coral wound healing and growth

Factors:
  1. Fish Presence: Fish vs. No Fish
  2. Wound Size: No Wound, Small (~1 cm²), Large (~3 cm²)

Replication: 72 coral fragments (12 per treatment combination)

Duration: 21 days

Species: Pocillopora spp.

DATA QUALITY & NOTES
================================================================================

Advantages of Excel Format:
  - Preserves formulas showing calculation steps
  - Easier for visual inspection and QC
  - Can include multiple sheets (though only one used here)

Disadvantages:
  - Not machine-readable in analysis scripts
  - Potential for formula errors
  - Version control issues

Recommendation:
  Use CSV version (fish_regen_buoyantweight (1).csv) for all analyses.
  Use this Excel file for:
    - Verifying calculations
    - Quality control
    - Understanding calculation workflow

Known Issues:
  - None identified

Quality Checks Performed:
  - Negative growth values inspected (corals 45, 91 removed as outliers)
  - Extreme values flagged (coral 103)
  - Density calculations verified against oceanographic tables


CALCULATIONS & FORMULAS
================================================================================

Seawater Density (density_sw):
  Based on temperature using standard seawater equation of state
  Typical range at 26-27°C: 0.987-0.988 g/cm³

Stopper Density (density_stopper):
  Formula: ρ_stopper = M_air / V_stopper
  Where: V_stopper = (M_air - M_fresh) / ρ_freshwater
  Expected value: ~2.2-2.3 g/cm³ (rubber stopper)

Dry Mass (dry_mass):
  Formula: M_dry = M_buoyant × (ρ_aragonite / (ρ_aragonite - ρ_sw))
  This derives from: M_dry = (M_buoyant × ρ_aragonite) / (ρ_aragonite - ρ_sw)
  Where:
    - M_buoyant = measured buoyant weight
    - ρ_aragonite = 2.93 g/cm³
    - ρ_sw = calculated seawater density

Coral Volume (coral_vol):
  Formula: V_coral = M_dry / ρ_aragonite
  Assumes entire skeleton is aragonite (valid for Pocillopora)

Growth Deltas (dry_mass_delta, vol_delta):
  Calculated by matching coral_id between initial and final timepoints
  Delta = Final value - Initial value
  Positive delta = growth
  Negative delta = measurement error or actual tissue loss
