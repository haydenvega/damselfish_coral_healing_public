GENERAL INFORMATION
================================================================================

Dataset Title: Coral Photosynthetic Efficiency - PAM Fluorometry Measurements

Principal Investigators:
  - Hayden Vega
  - Adrian Stier

Date of Data Collection: August 29, 2024 (Day 21 of experiment)

Geographic Location: Mo'orea, French Polynesia

Related Publications: [To be added]

Repository: damselfish_coral_healing_public


METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
================================================================================

Measurement Technique: Pulse-Amplitude Modulated (PAM) Fluorometry

Equipment: [PAM fluorometer model]

Protocol:
  1. Corals dark-adapted for 15-30 minutes
  2. Minimum fluorescence (F0) measured with weak modulated light
  3. Saturating pulse applied to close all reaction centers
  4. Maximum fluorescence (Fm) measured during saturating pulse
  5. Variable fluorescence (Fv) calculated: Fv = Fm - F0
  6. Quantum efficiency calculated: Fv/Fm = (Fm - F0) / Fm

Target Metric: Fv/Fm Ratio
  - Represents maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II
  - Healthy corals: Fv/Fm = 0.60-0.70 (reported as 600-700 in some datasets)
  - Stressed corals: Fv/Fm < 0.50
  - Used as indicator of photosynthetic health

Tissue Sampling Strategies:
  1. Undisturbed tissue: Coral tissue away from wound site
  2. Healed tissue: New tissue that grew over wound site
  3. Both: Combined measurements from both tissue types

Quality Control:
  - Multiple measurements per coral when possible
  - Dark adaptation time standardized
  - Measurements taken at same time of day
  - Algae presence noted


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
================================================================================

Experiment: Effects of damselfish presence and wound size on coral photosynthetic efficiency

Treatments:
  1. Fish Presence (2 levels):
     - Fish: Dascyllus damselfish present
     - No Fish: No fish present

  2. Wound Size (3 levels):
     - No Wound: Unwounded control
     - Small: ~1 cm² wound
     - Large: ~3 cm² wound

Replication: 72 coral fragments (12 per treatment combination)

Duration: Measurements at Day 21 (end of experiment)

Species: Pocillopora spp.

Hypothesis:
  Fish presence may enhance coral photosynthetic efficiency through:
    - Nutrient provisioning (ammonium)
    - Protection from algal competitors
    - Reduced stress

DATA QUALITY & NOTES
================================================================================

Fv/Fm Scaling:
  - Values reported as 500-800 (multiply by 0.001 to get 0.5-0.8)
  - Standard Fv/Fm scale is 0-1
  - Healthy Pocillopora: 0.60-0.70

Algal Colonization:
  - 8 corals developed algae during experiment
  - Heavily biased toward No Fish treatment (7 of 8)
  - Tested as potential confound - NOT significant (p = 0.106)
  - Algae data only in pam_healed.csv and comprehensive dataset

Missing Data:
  - initial_wound_size: NA for no-wound controls (expected)
  - Some blank cells in initial_wound_size column

Statistical Considerations:
  - Tank used as random effect in all models
  - Fv/Fm treated as continuous response
  - Normal distribution appropriate after model diagnostics
  - DHARMa diagnostics show good model fit


SUMMARY STATISTICS
================================================================================

Overall Fv/Fm Range: 500-800 (0.50-0.80)

Mean Fv/Fm by Treatment (×1000 scale):
  From pam_undisturbed_healed_tissue_wound_no_wound.csv:
    - No Fish, No Wound: 683.6 ± 12.06
    - No Fish, Small: 657.0 ± 43.46
    - No Fish, Large: 633.1 ± 35.68
    - Fish, No Wound: 685.9 ± 11.63
    - Fish, Small: 674.0 ± 27.00
    - Fish, Large: 684.4 ± 11.62

Pattern:
  - Fish treatment shows higher Fv/Fm than No Fish
  - Wound size shows some reduction, especially in No Fish treatment
  - Fish appears to buffer wound stress effects


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Model Structure:
  fv_fm ~ fish * wound + (1 | tank)

Where:
  - Response: fv_fm (photosynthetic efficiency, 0-1000 scale)
  - Fixed effects: fish (2 levels) × wound (3 levels)
  - Random effect: tank (12 levels)

Model Type: Linear mixed-effects model (lme4::lmer)

Hypothesis Tests:
  - Fish effect: Likelihood ratio test
  - Wound effect: Likelihood ratio test
  - Fish × Wound interaction: Likelihood ratio test

Results (from pam_analysis.Rmd):
  - Fish: SIGNIFICANT effect
  - Wound: Measurable effects
  - Interaction: NOT significant

Diagnostics:
  - DHARMa simulated residuals (n=1000)
  - QQ plots: Normal distribution appropriate
  - Residual plots: Homoscedastic, no patterns
