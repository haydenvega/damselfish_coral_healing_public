METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
================================================================================

Description:
This dataset contains buoyant weight measurements used to determine coral
skeletal mass. Buoyant weighing is a standard technique in coral biology
for measuring skeletal growth non-destructively.

Method:
Buoyant weighing technique using Archimedes' principle. Corals are weighed
underwater, and skeletal mass is calculated using the density of aragonite
(the mineral form of calcium carbonate in coral skeletons).

Formula:
  Dry Mass (g) = Buoyant Weight × (ρ_aragonite / (ρ_aragonite - ρ_seawater))

Where:
  - ρ_aragonite = 2.93 g/cm³ (constant)
  - ρ_seawater calculated from temperature and salinity measurements

Measurement Equipment:
  - Precision balance for underwater weighing
  - Temperature probes for water temperature
  - Calibration standard (stopper of known mass)

Quality Control:
  - Calibration standard measured in air, freshwater, and saltwater
  - Temperature recorded for density corrections
  - Outliers identified and removed: Coral IDs 45, 91, 103


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
================================================================================

Experiment: Effects of damselfish presence on coral wound healing and growth

Factors:
  1. Fish Presence (2 levels):
     - Fish: Dascyllus damselfish present
     - No Fish: No fish present

  2. Wound Size (3 levels):
     - No Wound: Control, no artificial wound
     - Small: ~1 cm² wound
     - Large: ~3 cm² wound

Replication: 72 coral fragments (12 per treatment combination)

Experimental Units: Individual coral fragments

Blocking: 12 tanks (6 corals per tank, one per treatment combination)

Duration: 21 days (August 8-29, 2024)

Species: Pocillopora spp. (branching coral)

CALCULATIONS & DERIVED METRICS
================================================================================

From this dataset, the following metrics are calculated:

1. Seawater Density (ρ_sw):
   Calculated from salt_temp_c using standard oceanographic equations

2. Stopper Density (ρ_stopper):
   ρ_stopper = air_weight_g / ((air_weight_g - fresh_weight_g) / ρ_freshwater)

3. Dry Mass (g):
   Dry_mass = bouyantweight_g × (ρ_aragonite / (ρ_aragonite - ρ_sw))

4. Coral Volume (cm³):
   Volume = dry_mass / ρ_aragonite

5. Growth Metrics:
   - Absolute growth (g) = Final dry mass - Initial dry mass
   - Relative growth = (Final mass - Initial mass) / Initial mass
   - Allometric growth = log(Final mass / Initial mass^b)
     where b = allometric scaling coefficient (~0.7-0.9)
