PURPOSE
================================================================================

These files serve as the MASTER RECORD of:
  - Treatment assignments (Fish × Wound factorial design)
  - Tank assignments (blocking/random effects)
  - Coral collection and fragmentation dates
  - Surface area measurements (SA file only)

These are REFERENCE files used to:
  - Link corals to treatments across all analyses
  - Provide tank information for random effects in models
  - Document surface area for growth standardization
  - Record qualitative outcomes (wound closure, necrosis)

FILE 2: Copy of fish_regen_mastersheet_wound closure_necrosis - mastersheet.csv
================================================================================

Description:
  SIMPLIFIED mastersheet WITHOUT surface area data.
  Used primarily for tank assignments in statistical models.

File Format: CSV

Number of Records: 72 corals

File Size: ~2.6 KB

Analysis Scripts Using This File:
  - allometric_growth_analysis.Rmd (source for tank random effects)

Variable List:
  Same as File 1, EXCEPT:
    - NO SA_cal column
    - Column order slightly different (wound_close and necrosis at end)

Variables (in order):
  1. coral_id
  2. date_collected
  3. date_fragment
  4. fish
  5. wound
  6. tank
  7. notes
  8. wound_close
  9. necrosis

Purpose:
  - Provide tank assignments for random effects
  - Lighter file without surface area data
  - Backup/redundancy for treatment assignments

Why Two Files?
  - File 1: Added SA_cal data after initial mastersheet created
  - File 2: Original file preserved for tank info
  - Both contain same core treatment data
  - File naming suggests File 2 is "Copy of" File 1


TREATMENT STRUCTURE
================================================================================

Experimental Design: 2 × 3 Factorial

Factor 1: Fish Presence (2 levels)
  - Fish (fish = 1): Dascyllus damselfish present
    - 3-4 adult damselfish per tank
    - Fish allowed to interact naturally with corals
  - No Fish (fish = 0): No fish present
    - Control tanks without fish

Factor 2: Wound Size (3 levels)
  - No Wound (wound = 0): Unwounded control
    - No artificial damage to coral
  - Small (wound = 1): ~1 cm² wound
    - Created with biopsy punch or drill
    - Target area 1 cm²
  - Large (wound = 2): ~3 cm² wound
    - Created with larger tool
    - Target area 3 cm²

Replication:
  - 12 corals per treatment combination
  - 72 corals total (2 × 3 × 12 = 72)

Blocking:
  - 12 tanks (experimental blocks)
  - 6 corals per tank (one per treatment combination)
  - Tank used as random effect in all models

Randomization:
  - Treatment combinations randomly assigned to corals within tanks
  - Tanks positioned to minimize environmental gradients


CODING CONVENTIONS
================================================================================

Fish:
  - Numeric: 0 = No Fish, 1 = Fish
  - Factor: "No Fish", "Fish" (used in analyses)
  - Factor levels ordered: "No Fish" → "Fish"

Wound:
  - Numeric: 0 = No Wound, 1 = Small, 2 = Large
  - Factor: "No Wound", "Small", "Large" (used in analyses)
  - Factor levels ordered: "No Wound" → "Small" → "Large"

Tank:
  - Numeric: 1-12
  - Treated as categorical factor in models
  - Random effect: (1 | tank)

Wound Closure:
  - "yes" = Wound completely closed by Day 21
  - "no" = Wound still visible at Day 21
  - "NA" = No wound treatment (control corals)

Necrosis:
  - "yes" = Tissue necrosis observed during experiment
  - "no" = No necrosis observed


DATA QUALITY & NOTES
================================================================================

Treatment Balance:
  - Each tank contains exactly one coral per treatment combination
  - Perfect balance: 12 replicates per treatment
  - No missing cells in design

Coral Substitutions:
  - Some notes indicate coral substitutions (e.g., "128 subbed out 89")
  - Substitutions made early in experiment due to mortality/damage
  - Final dataset reflects substituted corals

Surface Area Data Quality:
  - SA_cal from calibrated wax dipping (see wax_dip_surface_area_METADATA.txt)
  - Most corals: 40-110 cm²
  - Outlier: Coral 103 (319.4 cm², removed from analyses)
  - Precision: ±5-10% (estimated from calibration curve)

Known Issues:
  - Some notes contain "#NAME?" (Excel formula errors, does not affect data)
  - Wound closure is qualitative ("yes"/"no"), quantitative data in other file
  - Date format as YYYYMMDD integers (convert if needed)

Missing Data:
  - No missing treatment assignments
  - No missing tank assignments
  - wound_close = "NA" for no-wound controls (expected, not missing)

USAGE GUIDELINES
================================================================================

Use File 1 (with SA_cal) when:
  ✓ Need surface area for growth analysis
  ✓ Performing allometric scaling
  ✓ One-stop file for treatment + surface area

Use File 2 (without SA_cal) when:
  ✓ Only need tank assignments for random effects
  ✓ Want lighter file without surface area
  ✓ Cross-checking treatment assignments

Both files provide:
  ✓ Treatment assignments (fish, wound)
  ✓ Tank assignments (blocking)
  ✓ Coral metadata (dates, notes)
  ✓ Qualitative outcomes (wound_close, necrosis)

In R Analysis:
  # File 1 (with surface area)
  library(tidyverse)
  library(here)
  sa_data <- read_csv(here("data",
    "fish_regen_mastersheet_wound closure_necrosis_sa - mastersheet.csv"))

  # File 2 (tank info only)
  tank_data <- read_csv(here("data",
    "Copy of fish_regen_mastersheet_wound closure_necrosis - mastersheet.csv"))

  # Convert numeric codes to factors
  sa_data <- sa_data %>%
    mutate(
      fish = factor(fish, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No Fish", "Fish")),
      wound = factor(wound, levels = c(0, 1, 2),
                     labels = c("No Wound", "Small", "Large")),
      tank = factor(tank)
    )


STATISTICAL USAGE
================================================================================

Treatment Factors:
  All analyses use these as fixed effects:
    - fish (2 levels)
    - wound (3 levels)
    - fish × wound interaction

Random Effects:
  Tank used as random intercept in all models:
    lmer(response ~ fish * wound + (1 | tank), data = ...)

Rationale:
  - Tank accounts for environmental variation between tanks
  - Corals within same tank share environment (non-independence)
  - Random intercept allows baseline to vary by tank
  - Reduces Type I error rate

Model Formula:
  response ~ fish * wound + (1 | tank)

Where response is:
  - healing_rate (wound_closure_analysis.Rmd)
  - allometric_growth (allometric_growth_analysis.Rmd)
  - fv_fm (pam_analysis.Rmd)
