METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
================================================================================

Measurement Technique: Double Wax-Dipping Method

Principle:
  The wax-dipping method estimates 3D surface area by measuring the mass
  of a thin wax coating applied to the object. A calibration curve is
  created using geometric standards of known surface area, then applied
  to coral measurements.

Protocol:
  1. CALIBRATION STANDARDS:
     - Measure cylindrical standards with known dimensions
     - Calculate true surface area: SA = 2πr² + 2πr×L (cylinder)
     - Weigh standard after first wax dip
     - Weigh standard after second wax dip
     - Calculate wax mass difference
     - Generate calibration curve: SA ~ wax_mass

  2. CORAL MEASUREMENTS:
     - Weigh coral after first wax dip
     - Weigh coral after second wax dip
     - Calculate wax mass difference
     - Apply calibration curve to estimate surface area

Advantages:
  - Non-destructive
  - Accounts for complex 3D branching morphology
  - More accurate than 2D projections for branching corals

Limitations:
  - Requires careful dipping technique
  - Wax temperature must be consistent
  - Small corals can be challenging

Quality Control:
  - Multiple standards spanning range of coral sizes
  - Standards re-measured to verify consistency
  - Outliers inspected and remeasured when possible


EXPERIMENTAL CONTEXT
================================================================================

Purpose:
  Surface area measurements used to standardize coral growth rates for
  size differences (allometric scaling).

Why Surface Area Matters:
  - Coral growth scales non-linearly with size (allometric relationship)
  - Larger corals grow faster in absolute terms
  - Surface area provides size metric independent of 3D geometry
  - Growth rate per unit surface area allows fair comparison across sizes

Use in Analysis:
  - Allometric scaling coefficient (b) estimated from initial measurements
  - Size-corrected growth = log(final_mass / initial_mass^b)
  - Surface area used to calculate growth per cm²

CALIBRATION DETAILS
================================================================================

Calibration Model:
  calculated_sa ~ wax_weight_diff

Model Type: Linear regression

Expected Relationship: Positive linear

Calibration Equation:
  SA_cal = intercept + slope × wax_weight_diff

Quality Metrics:
  - R²: [from SA_calibration_calculations_5_13.R]
  - RMSE: [from script]
  - Range validated: 0.5-3.0 g wax_diff (0.15-1.33 g for standards)

Extrapolation Warning:
  - Coral 103 (11.24 g) far outside calibration range
  - Estimate unreliable, coral removed from analyses


WOUND SIZE ADJUSTMENTS
================================================================================

In Analysis:
  Surface area is adjusted to account for wound area removed:

  SA_adjusted = SA_cal - wound_area

Where:
  - No Wound: SA_adjusted = SA_cal (no adjustment)
  - Small Wound: SA_adjusted = SA_cal - 1 cm²
  - Large Wound: SA_adjusted = SA_cal - 3 cm²

Rationale:
  - Wax dipping performed on intact corals
  - Wounds created after surface area measurement
  - Growth rate per unit area should account for reduced starting area

See allometric_growth_analysis.Rmd lines 155-162 for implementation


DATA QUALITY & NOTES
================================================================================

Measurement Precision:
  - Wax weight: ±0.01 g (balance precision)
  - Dimensions: ±0.1 mm (caliper precision)
  - Surface area: ±5-10% (estimated from calibration curve error)

Outliers:
  - Coral 103: SA_cal = 319.4 cm² (likely error, removed from analyses)
  - Some corals > 100 cm²: Large fragments, but within expected range

Quality Issues:
  - 6 corals "fell off in bleach" - identity uncertain
  - Some notes contain Excel errors ("#NAME?")
  - These do not affect numeric data quality

Missing Data: None (all corals measured)

Validation:
  - Standards show good linear relationship
  - Coral SA values reasonable for Pocillopora fragments
  - Values match expected size distribution
